# Tracify (work in progress)

it's an app that helps us find lost objects

a user puts in keywords of what their object looks like

then the user who finds the object clicks the pic and uploads it. llava endpoint gives us keywords for that and checks if it matches keyword of any object. If such an object is found, the user is notified.
